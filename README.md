# Tic Tac Toe Game using Python and Tkinter

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game allows two players to play a game of tic-tac-toe on a shared device.

## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players, represented by "X" and "O", take turns to mark a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game [Source 6].

## Installation

Before you can run the game, you need to install Python and a couple of Python libraries: `Tkinter` and `random`. You can do this using pip, the Python package installer. If you haven't installed pip yet, follow this guide to get started: [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Once you have pip installed, you can install the required libraries by opening a terminal and running the following commands:

```
pip install python-tk
pip install random2
```

## Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the `ttt.py` file in your terminal. Then, run the following command:

```
python ttt.py
```

Enjoy the game!
